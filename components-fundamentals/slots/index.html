        also, we can use multiple elements inside the todo-items-->
        <todo-item>
            Buy bananas
            <!-- if we didn't use the template element, the paragraph would be rendered in the first slot
            and wherever we're checking the checkbox, the paragraph will be also have the line-through applied-->

            <template #description>
                <p>Bananas are good for your health</p>

        <!-- with slots, instead of passing the item to the component using props
        we pass the content into the element itself, just like a normal html-->

        <div>
            <input type="checkbox" v-model="done">
         <!-- in order to define a slot, we use the slot element -->
         <!-- we want to set the 'done' class to the slot element based on the value of the variable 'done'
        we can also write just "{done}" because the variable has the same name with the class-->
        <!-- if we are doing this and try to use a class binding on the slot elem itself it won't work
        because when the component is rendered, the slot elem is replaced with what we pass into it
        so, to make it work, we can wrap the slot elem inside another element and apply the class binding inside that elem-->
            <span :class="{done: done}">
                <slot></slot>
            </span>    
            <!-- we can use multiple slots-->
            <slot name="description"></slot>
            <!-- whatever content we put into the todo-item elem will be rendered in the default slot
            so we have to use the v-slot directive on a template element providing the name of the slot
            as the v-slot's argument-->

            <button><slot name="button-text">Highlight</slot></button>
            <!-- by default the button slot is required for all of the items
            so, in order to make it optional we can provide a default value
            so, if the button-text is provided, it will replace the slot elem,
            but if it's not provided the default content will be displayed-->
        </div>
        <!-- slots cs props
         when we need to pass html or ther markup to a component, slots are are the way to go
         when we need to pass data to a component, props are perfect
         we can use both on the same component-->
