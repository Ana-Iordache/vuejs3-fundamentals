        <!-- we use :class to add e class dinamically when the plan is selected; we have to wrap the class name in quotes-->
        <!-- a single plan shoul be selected and have the active-plan class; so when we're selecting a plan, the first should.t be selected anymore
        how can we do that - to know from inside the component that another plan is selected?
      -> we could probbly use props, but the parent is not aware if a plan is selected;
    we can let the parent know when the user selects a plan => custom event (with $emit in the method select())-->

        :selected="plan === selectedPlan"
        v-on:select="selectPlan" 
        ></plan-picker-item> <!-- name is a prop which we defined in app.js-->
        <!-- with ":name" we bind the value of each plan with name-->
        <!-- when the select event takes place, we trigger the selectPlan method 
          -> the PlanPickerComponent needs to know which plan the user has selected; we add a data property: selectedPlan-->
        <!-- in :selected we check is selected, and that selected prop will be true-->

<!-- SO, IN THIS COMMIT WE DID THE FOLLOWING:
- when the plan is clicked we call the select method with @click
- the select method emits a custom event; the payload of this event is the plan to be selected
- in the parent, we listen to the select event with v-on:selected;
- and, when it happens we call the selectPlan method which gets the plan from the payload and it sets it to the data (this.selectedPlan)
- then, we pass the selected prop to the individual plans by comparing the plan to selectedPlan => boolean value passed to the slected prop
- finally, in the template we use a class binding (:class) to conditionally apply the active-plan class based on if the plan is selected-->
